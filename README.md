# atlang
This is the project for the formal languages anc compilers at the [University of Bergamo](https://www.unibg.it/) for the academic year 2019/2020.
Using ANTLR we define a language for the definition of turing machine and convert the language in a python executable.

## Usage
To use this tool 
	`java -jar atlang.jar filename.t`
if you don't specify the file name the software
will use `test.t` in resource directory
After the execution you'll find `filename.py` in the `pyOut/` directory

## Documentation
Is possible to find a detailed documentation about this project in the [repository Wiki](https://github.com/Addooo/atlang/wiki)
